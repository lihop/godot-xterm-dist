# NOTICE
This repository is a mirror of <https://github.com/lihop/godot-xterm> that includes release binaries for distribution via the [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset) and installation by [gd-plug](https://github.com/imjp94/gd-plug) and other plugin managers.
It also includes the exported HTML5 demo for hosting on GitHub Pages.
These files are kept separate from the main repository in order to keep its size down.
**All issues and pull requests for GodotXterm should be submitted to the [original repository](https://github.com/lihop/godot-xterm)**.

The binary files distributed in this repository are produced by GitHub Actions and copied from the [realeases](https://github.com/lihop/godot-xterm/releases) section of the original repository.
Debug versions can also be downloaded there.

The Godot Asset Library does support downloading from GitHub Releases using a custom download link, but this option is currently only available to moderators.
See proposal [godotengine/godot-proposals/#1198](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/1198) for improved GDNative support in the Asset Library.
